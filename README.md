AxiomVis: An Axiom-Oriented Ontology Visualization Tool
=====================================

Abstract. With the continuous growth of ontologies in size, the amount of ontology axioms is  steadily increasing. To help users understand ontologies with a large number of axioms, we devise a novel ontology visualization tool,called   AxiomVis, which defines a mapping from DL axioms to the directed acyclic graph (DAG). We give a recursive \<br> procedure to generate the target DAG and then propose a new axiom-aware layout algorithm to display the DAG elements \<br> using the characteristics of the expression tree. The distinguishing feature of our tool is that it visualizes ontologies from the axiom viewpoint. \<br> This paper demonstrates comparison of different layouts, which exhibits the advantages of our layout on ontology visualization.
