AxiomVis: An Axiom-Oriented Ontology Visualization Tool
=====================================
    __Abstract__ 
    
    With the continuous growth of ontologies in size, the amount of ontology axioms is steadily increasing.
To help users understand ontologies with a large number of axioms, we devise a novel ontology visualization tool,called AxiomVis, which defines a mapping from DL   
    axioms to the directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
We give a recursive procedure to generate the target DAG and then propose a new axiom-aware layout algorithm 
to display the DAG elements using the characteristics of the expression tree. The distinguishing feature of 
our tool is that it visualizes ontologies from the axiom viewpoint. This paper demonstrates comparison of 
different layouts, which exhibits the advantages of our layout on
ontology visualization.
