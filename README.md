    Abstract. With the continuous growth of ontologies in size, the amount
of ontology axioms is steadily increasing. To help users understand ontologies
with a large number of axioms, we devise a novel ontology visualization
tool, called AxiomVis, which defines a mapping from DL axioms
to the directed acyclic graph (DAG). We give a recursive procedure to
generate the target DAG and then propose a new axiom-aware layout
algorithm to display the DAG elements using the characteristics of the
expression tree. The distinguishing feature of our tool is that it visualizes
ontologies from the axiom viewpoint. This paper demonstrates comparison
of different layouts, which exhibits the advantages of our layout on
ontology visualization.
